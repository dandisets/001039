description: " Large-scale brain recordings (32 CH) of local field potentials (LFP)
  were used to identify neural signatures linked with social preference deficits following
  frontal brain injury. \nControlled-cortical impact model used to create a severe
  bilateral injury centered over prefrontal cortex in 12 male Long-Evans rats. 9 rats
  were sham controls (matching surgical conditions, no TBI). Rats were 7 months old
  at the time of surgery. 2 weeks after TBI, behavior and brain activity during a
  three-chamber social exploration task were compared between sham and injured animals.
  We used a standard three-chamber maze, 80×40×40 cm in size (Maze Engineers, Skokie,
  IL, USA). The subject was placed in the medial chamber and allowed to explore freely
  for 30 minutes. The lateral chambers contained a social (conspecific) and non-social
  stimulus (novel object: rubber duck)\nA video camera (Arducam Wide Angle, Amazon)
  recorded activity from the bottom of the sociability chamber. The video was recorded
  at 20 fps. The raw data included here contains streams of video data and 32 CH of
  LFP data ( recorded at a sampling rate of 6KHz, 1000Hz low-pass filter, 0.1Hz high-pass
  filter, and 60Hz notch filter. Raw data is stored as a .tev file). \n"
